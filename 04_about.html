        <h1>This website was made by: Skyler</h1>
        <p>
         During hosting this website the free tier website restricted me to use upload and use those images which i was using by downloading so i had to find out the imanges but it was hard bcz it was more that 180 imanges 
         so i googleed netflix imanges  stack and found a guy had made netflix clone which i regret alot why did i not think of searching netflix clone so i didnt have to waste 1 day to coding this shit : then i took his image src and put into my code 
         so if you see the img missing then plz try to understand he deleted his repo from google 
            I got this idea because of Shruti XD. Once we were playing games and chatting, and she mentioned somethingâ€”I don't remember exactly what, but it sparked the idea for this website. So, thanks to her!
        </p>
        <h3>Soon, I will post future updates for this website. Currently, it's only 15% of my plan XD. I will share the complete plan here; I have it written in text.</h3>
